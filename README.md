# LystingsRUs
> Are you a realtor looking to post a new lysting? Or maybe you're not a realtor, and are looking for a new apartment? This application has got it!

Using Ruby on Rails, LystingsRUS was created to connect realtors to others that are looking to for apartments to rent. If you are a realtor, you can post a new listing; also, edit or delete your OWN listing, not others'. As a realtor you cannot leave a review. If you are not a realtor you are allowed to add a review. You are also able to favorited listings, or remove them. Both users are able to message other users.
